# Welcome to this page that is made by Ph.D students for new comers (intern or Ph.D)

We hope that everything that is in there will be somehow helpful. From LaTeX templates and tools to scripts to launch jobs and a non-exhaustive summary of what you may need in your work, there are a lot of things to take of (but also missing probably). There are things accessible to students from any expriments like the LaTeX part. However, this is mainly towards LHC/CMS people !
There might be things that you do not understand at first, or things that are not useful at all. This repo is made to give some help about a lot of things. Please be kind :D.
You can check the pdf file to have all the information that you may need or want !

# Have a good Ph.D !
